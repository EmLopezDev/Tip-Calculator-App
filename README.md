## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS custom properties, functions, and mixins
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

-   My biggest take away was how tricky dealing with decimal number and calculations in Javascript can be because of the way JavaScript stores decimals.

### Continued development

-   Contining to work with vanilla JavaScript, I want to gain a stronger understanding of its fundamentals before moving on the a framework/library.

### Useful resources

-   [Number() vs parseInt()](https://priyanshitaneja.medium.com/understanding-javascript-number-and-parseint-a-comprehensive-guide-390020d40d2d) - Learning the differnce between `Number()` and `parseInt()` and when/how to use them.
